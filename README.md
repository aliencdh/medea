# medea
Medea is aiming to be a lighteight and highly customizable application launcher.

# Goals
- Support for configuration in Lua and TOML
- Easily theme-able
- Entirely customizable rendering modes (for example, being able to render the menu as a "wheel", rather than the general rectangular shape that dmenu and rofi use).
